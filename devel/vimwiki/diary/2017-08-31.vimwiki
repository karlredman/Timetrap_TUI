# Journal: Work so far -move to json

I'm still working on phase 1. The delay is mostly due to some personal things needing to be done away from the computer -life stuff. I've familiarized myself with javascript enough that I think I know how I want to design this program. The main idea is that I want to use the same source for an eventual web interface -possibly with [gollum-vimwiki-integration](https://github.com/karlredman/Vimwiki-Gollum-Integration). I had originally wanted to use the method shown in [blessed-contrib/explorer.js at master Â· yaronn/blessed-contrib](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib/blob/master/examples/explorer.js). However, it's evident to me that I might as well build this app. more traditionally with proper data structures and such. This is why phase 1 notes appear to be all over the place. I'll pull things together closer to phase 2.
