# Update: Lost time.

This project got derailed for a few days while if figure out some of the intricacies of the blessed framework. I've found some inconsistencies between blessed proper and blessed-contrib that are somewhat frustrating. I went through a period of questioning the layout I've created because I consider it to be ugly as well. Also I've been sick for the past several days -mostly allergies. Making progress on a project when feeling crappy or while being bogged down in whack-a-mole user interface issues and overall program design constraints is very difficult. This project does not lack vision or motivation. There really isn't a whole lot of feature creep going on. But my energy level has been really low lately for reasons already stated.

I've settled to keeping the current layout so that I can publish this project and start using it. It's likely I'll have a better idea how I want to change things around in the future. The primary task at hand is just getting the timetrap features working so I can move on with the other things that need to be done -like building the web page on github, etc. I've never built and/or posted a javascript package/project before so I expect a fair amount of work to be done there. There's really not a lot of programming left do do on this project. Most of what is left todo for a first release is packaging. Ultimately there's a rewrite that is already in the works but refactoring will be a priority first.  The main focus right now is just to get **anything** that works up to github and go from there.
